  "content": "This smell occurs when a test method tests for the same condition multiple times within the same test method. If the test method needs to test the same condition using different values, a new test method should be utilized; the name of the test method should be an indication of the test being performed. Possible situations that would give rise to this smell include: (1) developers grouping multiple conditions to test a single method; (2) developers performing debugging activities; and (3) an accidental copy-paste of code.\n\nDetection: A test method that contains more than one assertion statement with the same parameters.",
