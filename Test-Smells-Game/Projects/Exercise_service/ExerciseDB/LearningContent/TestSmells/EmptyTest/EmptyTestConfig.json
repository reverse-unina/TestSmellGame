  "content": "Occurs when a test method does not contain executable statements. Such methods are possibly created for debugging purposes and then forgotten about or contains commented out code. An empty test can be considered problematic and more dangerous than not having a test case at all since JUnit will indicate that the test passes even if there are no executable statements present in the method body. As such, developers introducing behavior-breaking changes into production class, will not be notified of the alternated outcomes as JUnit will report the test as passing.\n\nDetection: A test method that contains an assertion statement in which the expected and actual parameters are the same.
