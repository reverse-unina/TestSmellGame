  "content": "By default Android Studio creates default test classes when a project is created. These classes are meant to serve as an example for developers when wring unit tests and should either be removed or renamed. Having such files in the project will cause developers to start adding test methods into these files, making the default test class a container of all test cases. This also would possibly cause problems when the classes need to be renamed in the future.",
