  "content": "In this mission, you will learn about the remaining test smells that we haven't covered yet. Understanding these last test smells will help you refine your ability to identify and fix issues that can make tests unreliable and difficult to maintain.\n\nBy the end of this mission, you will have a complete understanding of test smells and how to improve test quality through better practices.\n\nAt the end of the theoretical section, you will take a short quiz to test your knowledge. Don’t worry if you don’t pass on the first try—you can retake it as many times as you like!\n\nAnd remember, you can leave the mission at any time and resume from the last completed step.",
